# ðŸ¤– Robot Path Drawer (React Native + BLE + ESP32)

This is a **single-page React Native app** that lets you **draw paths on-screen** and then sends that path as **movement instructions** to an ESP32-controlled robot using **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**.

Once the drawing is complete, the app converts the path into real-world coordinates and generates robot commands like `move_forward` and `turn_left`. These commands are then sent over BLE to make your robot follow the drawn path.

## ðŸ“± Features

- ðŸŽ¨ Draw gestures directly on a canvas
- ðŸ”„ Converts drawings into real-world measurements
- ðŸ¤– Translates paths into robot movement commands
- ðŸ“¡ Sends instructions over BLE to ESP32
- ðŸ–¥ Clean UI and real-time feedback

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Draw** a path on the screen.
2. The app:
   - Converts canvas coordinates into centimeters.
   - Refines the path to remove tiny unnecessary movements.
   - Calculates angle and distance between points.
   - Generates an optimized command list for the robot.
3. **Connect** to the ESP32 over BLE.
4. **Send** the JSON command data to the robot.
5. The robot moves according to the path!
